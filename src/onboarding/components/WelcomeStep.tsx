        1. Financial Risk
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        By using this website/trading software interface, I certify that I accept the terms and conditions laid out below.
      </Typography>

      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.1</strong>: I understand that this is an open source financial tool, and the risks associated both with cryptocurrency and with interacting with open source software.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.2</strong>: I understand that by using trading strategies involving leverage the risk of loss of funds, either due to liquidation or to unsuccessful trades, is higher than spot trading; a fact accentuated by the inclusion of crypto assets as the underlying collateral and mark asset.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.3</strong>: I understand the risks related to the incursion of financial losses from the bot's algorithm, knowing that it is a newly built product with limited production test data.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.4</strong>: I understand the mechanisms by which leverage trading, specifically perpetual futures, functions.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.5</strong>: I understand that the bot runs on open-source code that can be freely downloaded, audited and verified on GitHub.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>1.6</strong>: I understand that by using this software, I am putting my assets under the control of the trading bot, where the program has (limited) access to the relevant private key.
      </Typography>

      <Divider sx={{ backgroundColor: "#444", margin: "2em 0" }} />

      <Typography variant="h5" sx={{...boldText, marginBottom: "1em" }}>
        2. Data Collection
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>2.1</strong>: Trading volume will be monitored on wallets which use this software, so as to infer the total volume routed via the bot. No additional data is stored, nor will the data that is stored by used for any additional purpose.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>2.2</strong>: We ask for information from the front-end client in order to set up the bot which we do not store. Sensitive information such as API keys and secrets are collected via the frontend and are used to create a `.env` file that stores these values. The values are not used further, and I can verify this fact myself via reviewing the UI repository on Github
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>2.3</strong>: When working with project devs to debug any errors that may occur, I understand that they will never ask for my private keys.
      </Typography>

      <Divider sx={{ backgroundColor: "#444", margin: "2em 0" }} />

      <Typography variant="h5" sx={{ ...boldText, marginBottom: "1em" }}>
        3. Security
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>3.1</strong>: I should never, under any circumstances, give anyone my private keys - and I understand the risks of doing so.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>3.2</strong>: If I run the bot on my laptop or personal computer, I understand the importance of keeping it in a safe location to protect my private keys.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>3.3</strong>: I understand the importance of security updates on the codebase and reaching out to developers if I have concerns over a code update.
      </Typography>

      <Divider sx={{ backgroundColor: "#444", margin: "2em 0" }} />

      <Typography variant="h5" sx={{ ...boldText, marginBottom: "1em" }}>
        4. Front-end Interface
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>4.1.1</strong>: I understand that the front-end interface is only used for setting up and interacting with the bot.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1">
        <strong>4.1.2</strong>: I understand that the front-end interface requires the address and port of my locally hosted backend server.
